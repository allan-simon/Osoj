Open source online judge (osoj)


Osoj is written in python, using webpy

It requires python2.6
a recent version of webpy
and GCC to compile the test proposed by students

for the moment it will works only on linux 
(though it should be not so hard to port it to works on windows and even less on
other unix system(it may works out of the box for them))

Don't forget to compile the libc in the libc folder
